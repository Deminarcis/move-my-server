### Move My Server

Move My Server is a small script that allows users to easily move a server from one hypervisor to another.

I hope you find it useful!

#### Requirements

You will only need Python to begin with but in the spirit of transparency this script will make sure the following are installed:

- Python (2.7)
- rsync

If you dont have these installed then the script will get them from your package manager.

#### Supported / Tested on:

- Debian 8 (Jessie)
- CentOS 7 (1511 build)

#### Installation
unzip and run.

### Issues / Bug Reporting

All bugs can be submitted over at [The Github Issues page for this project](https://github.com/Deminarcis/move-my-server/issues)

#### TODO
- Add OpenSUSE support for all features
- Add support for specifying destination's port (we don't all use port 22 for SSH)
