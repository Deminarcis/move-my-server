### Move My Server

Move My Server is a small script that is designed to allow users to easily move a server from one hypervisor to another. This script aims to handle everything but the destination by itself.

Currently this script is written to work with CentOS 6 and 7. If i get enough use from it i may expand this later.

I hope you find it useful!

#### Requirements

This script relies on
- Python (2.7 or better should work just fine)
- rsync
- A distro that uses Yum

#### Installation

No installation required , just put it in a directory and run as sudo/root
